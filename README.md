# 10a Exercises and Sandboxes

This project contains exercises that we may use in class during the semester.
To get newly released exercises, run the command `./get_exercises.sh` in the terminal
(the text area at the bottom of the screen).

You can also create your own Python files here to experiment. Just double-click
in the file browser to the left, type in a file name that ends with ".py" (e.g. 
`experiment.py`), and hit enter. You'll get a new, blank file where you can type
Python code, and run it with the "play" button at the top right of the text window.
