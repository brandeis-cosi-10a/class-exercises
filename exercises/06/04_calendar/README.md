# Calendar

Write a function, `print_cal(num_weeks, days_per_week)`, in [main.py](main.py) that prints out a calendar using the following rules:
1. Each week consists of `days_per_week` days.
1. For each day, print the day of the month.
   * e.g. print `5` for the 5th day of the month. Don't try to print the names of the days.
1. Each week should be printed on a single line.
1. `num_weeks` weeks should be printed.

## Bonus

Use the internet to figure out how to align the rows of your calendar. Try searching for "fixed width" numbers or "left padding".
