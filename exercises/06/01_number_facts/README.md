# Number facts

Write your code in [main.py](main.py)
## Part 1

Write a `for` loop that iterates over at the numbers 60-70 (inclusive), and prints out 2 facts about each number:
1. The number divided by 3
1. Whether the number is a perfect square (Hint: `8 * 8 = 64`)

## Part 2

Write a `for` loop that iterates 10 times, and prompts the user for an integer each time. 

If the integer is positive, print "<num> is a great number!"

If the integer is negative, print "Try to be more positive!"
