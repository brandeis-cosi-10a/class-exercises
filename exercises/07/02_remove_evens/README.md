## Removing evens

Write 2 functions in [code.py](code.py):

1. `remove_evens_mutating(nums)` which removes even numbers from `nums`. The function should **mutate** nums in place.
1. `remove_evens_non_mutating(nums)` which returns a new list containing the odd numbers from `nums`. `nums` must not be mutated.

## Testing

Add unit tests for both methods.

Aside from asserting that each function correctly removes even numbers, what else is important to test for `remove_evens_non_mutating`? Hint: how can you be sure that `nums` isn't mutated?
