# Call stack maze

Use the debugger to answer the following questions about the code in [main.py](main.py):

1. How many times is `b()` called?
1. The 4th time `f()` is called, what are the values of `r`, `y`, and `z`?
1. What is the call stack the first time `e()` is called?
1. What is the call stack the first time `d()` calls `c()`?
1. What are the values of `r`, `y`, and `z` just before the program exits?
