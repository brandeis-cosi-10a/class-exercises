# Unit test practice

1. Open [code.py](code.py), and examine the code in it.
   * How many test cases are there?
1. Run the tests from the `Testing` tab (the beaker on the left hand side of the screen)
1. Fix the failing test
1. Add new test cases for the `add` function.
   * What cases might be interesting to test? What are inputs that might count as "special cases"?
1. Add new test cases for the `count_letters` function.
   * What cases are interesting to test? Read the comment in the function describing the expected behavior.
   * The `count_letters` function uses language features we haven't covered yet. You don't need to know
   _how_ the function itself works in order to write test cases for it!
