# Lifting weights

## Part 1

Write a function in [main.py](main.py) that takes 2 parameters: an object name, and a weight in grams.

The function should print out whether different animals could lift that object or not.

Ants can lift 250 mg (0.25 grams)
Swallows can lift 28 grams
Mice can lift 120 grams
Elephants can lift 6,000 kg (6,000,000 grams)

## Part 2

Change your function to print out how many of each object the animal could lift. Printing fractional objects is ok. 
For example, if a grape weighs 5 grams, a swallow could lift 5.6 (`28/5`) grapes. If a coconut weighs 1000 grams, a mouse could lift 0.12 coconuts (`120/1000`).
