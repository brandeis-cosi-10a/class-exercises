# Is it odd?

1. Write a function in [main](main.py) which takes a number as a parameter, and prints out "{number}... that's odd" if the number is odd, or "{number} looks even to me!" if the number is even.
   * Hint: you can use the modulo (`%`) operator to check if there is a remainder when dividing by 2.
1. Add at least 3 function calls in [main.py](main.py) to test your function. 
   * Which cases should you test? Think about different types of inputs you can send to your function.
