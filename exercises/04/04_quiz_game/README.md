Write a program in [main.py](main.py) which quizzes a player with a series of at least 5 questions.

The player should be awarded 1 point for each correct answer. 

If the player answers incorrectly 2 times, the quiz should end.

At the end of the quiz (win or lose), the program should print out the number of points the player earned.
