# Wikipedia

1. Install the `wikipedia` module:
   * Open the Terminal
   * Type `pip install wikipedia`
2. Check out the [Wikipedia library Quickstart Guide](https://wikipedia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#quickstart) and the [pypi page on the Wikipedia library](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/)
3. Write some code in [code.py](code.py) to print the summary of your favorite Wikipedia article
4. (Optional) If you want to go further, prompt the user for a topic, and print the summary of that topic.
   * Note that, to do this robustly, you'll have to catch and handle `DisambiguationError`s!
