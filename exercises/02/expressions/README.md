## Predict the output

[main.py](main.py) contains a series of expressions. For each one:

1. Predict what the expression will print, and write your prediction in a comment.
   * Note that some examples might produce an error instead of printing!
1. Uncomment the line of code, and run the program.
   * If the lines produce an error, fix the error to make them execute.
1. Check your prediction. Write down the actual output. If your prediction was wrong, write down the mistake or incorrect assumption you made.
