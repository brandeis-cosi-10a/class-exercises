1. Open [main.py](main.py)
1. Prompt the user for their name
1. Respond with a greeting
1. Prompt the user for their age in years
1. Print "You were probably born in {year}"
    * You can ignore whether they've already had a birthday this year - just subtract their age from 2025.
1. Print "You are approximately {seconds} old"
    * Again, you can ignore their birthdate - just calculate the number of seconds in a year, and multiply by their age.
    * Don't use a calculator to find the number of seconds in a year - use your code!
