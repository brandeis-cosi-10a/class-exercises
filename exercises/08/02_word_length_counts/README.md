# Count word lengths

## Part 1: Counting
Write a function in [code.py](code.py) which takes in a string, counts the number of words of each length, and prints them out.

For example, the string: `Hello class this string has many words of similar lengths`

Would produce: 
```
{ 
    2: 1, # of
    3: 1, # has
    4: 2, # this, many
    5: 3, # Hello, class, words
    6: 1, # string
    7: 2  # similar, lengths
}
```

## Part 2: Sorting

Now, print out the results in a sorted order: from most frequent to least frequent.
